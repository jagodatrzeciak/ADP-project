# 3D Structure Prediction and Disorder Analysis Toolkit

This toolkit provides two primary functionalities: 
- 3D Structure Prediction Using Multiple Methods: TODO
- Disorder Prediction and Visualization: This functionality runs IUPred for a provided UniProt ID or PDB file and colors the structure by disorder using PyMOL.

## Disorder Prediction and Visualization

### Overview
The second component of this toolkit allows users to analyze the intrinsic disorder
of protein structures. It utilizes the IUPred tool to predict disorder regions in protein sequence. The resulting 
predictions are then wizualized by coloring the protein structure in PyMOL.
